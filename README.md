A personal journey for programming. This is my story.

The Unpaid Cost of Unexpected Visibility: Why My Life Is Not Your Free Emotional Labor.

I need to set a clear boundary regarding my current public visibility. For the record, I am a dedicated student currently focused on a demanding project. Let me be absolutely clear: I did not choose to be an actor, a celebrity, or a public servant. My life has been severely impacted by this unexpected exposure, which is entirely outside of my control.

The public expects the emotional labor of a public figure—namely, constant kindness, smiles, and attention. However, this is where the inherent contract breaks down: Emotional labor demands compensation and a robust protective infrastructure. If you require me to be "on stage" and "friendly," you must provide the stage, the security, and the payment that comes with that role.

My reality is starkly different. I am a student taking public transport, dealing with this stressful intrusion without any of the necessary resources. I have no security, no separate private space, and certainly no income that would allow me to perform this "friendly" role without complete psychological burnout. To demand this level of emotional output from someone who is working to simply maintain their focus and sanity is fundamentally unjust and illogical.

When I choose to protect my boundaries by being reserved or distant, I am instantly judged: "But they aren't friendly." This judgement is simply the sound of someone being angry that they are not receiving a free, unsolicited service from a person who owes them nothing. It is a refusal to respect a person's basic right to privacy and self-preservation.

I will not apologize for protecting my boundaries. My energy is dedicated to my learning and my professional goals. If your only comment about me is related to my lack of a smile, it confirms that you are not interested in the person, but merely in extracting free emotional output. I refuse to participate in that exchange. Respect my privacy and my space. My focus is on my work. My life is not your entertainment. "For those who criticize my boundary and demand my performance: I have an offer for you. Step into my unchosen reality, endure this daily scrutiny, and then we will see how 'friendly' you remain. If you come here, I promise to make you famous—I will personally ensure you become as widely known as I am. You will get the spotlight you seem to desire." Watch your tone and your 'character' (or 'integrity'). How dare you evaluate anyone. Those are typical of slackers who aren't pulling their weight. I acknowledge that there are still decent people out there. I am willing to open my heart to those individuals who demonstrate genuine respect and empathy. However, I have absolutely no reason to engage with those who possess loose and trivial tongues. My time and energy are a premium resource, and I will not waste them on low-value exchanges.

If you are bored and seeking a smile, I suggest you go demand kindness at a celebrity fan signing event instead. My life is not your free emotional service.

Time is required for me to process and accept this reality. I need this space to adapt to the profound change in my life. However, let this be absolutely clear: even when I eventually accept this new path, I will never, under any circumstances, welcome back or forgive those who treated me disrespectfully. The line has been drawn. Those who mistook my silence for weakness or treated me arbitrarily will remain permanently outside my consideration. Acceptance of the situation is not an invitation to those who wronged me.

I will never, under any circumstances, welcome back or forgive those who treated me disrespectfully. I am granting myself the necessary time to process and ultimately accept this situation. But let my commitment be unequivocally clear: I possess an excellent memory for faces. To those disrespectful individuals: Try me. Once I have fully navigated this phase of acceptance, I may allow others to approach, but anyone who spoke ill of me or acted arbitrarily will be met with immediate legal action and a restraining order if they attempt contact.

Where do you get the nerve to speak so carelessly? I seriously question how any person capable of such reckless disregard for others' boundaries can possess the necessary integrity to execute any task or profession properly."
